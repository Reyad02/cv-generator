    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        RE: AI Backend Engineer position
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I am an results-driven software engineer specializing in Python, FastAPI, and AI-enabled applications, seeking an AI Backend Engineer role where I can contribute as a technically strong teammate. With hands-on experience designing scalable and maintainable systems, I have built robust REST APIs, integrated third-party services, and optimized data access to deliver high-quality software solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my recent role at TechNova Solutions (Backend Developer / Software Engineer, 2021–2023), I developed robust REST APIs using FastAPI, integrated third-party services, and optimized database queries while collaborating closely with frontend teams to ensure seamless user experiences. These efforts improved API performance and reliability, enabling faster feature delivery and better cross-team collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Earlier, at InnovateSoft Ltd (Python Developer / Junior Software Engineer, 2019–2020), I built internal tools with Python, automated data processing tasks, and supported cloud deployments. This work streamlined workflows, reduced manual effort, and contributed to more consistent data handling.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of Dhaka (2015–2019) with a CGPA of 3.65/4.00. My core skills include Python, FastAPI, Django, REST APIs, Machine Learning, Docker, and PostgreSQL. I am also actively exploring cloud deployment practices and ML model integration to deliver value-added AI solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team as an AI Backend Engineer, bringing a strong Python foundation, experience with FastAPI, and a passion for integrating AI into scalable backend services. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my background, skills, and goals align with your needs.
        </p>
